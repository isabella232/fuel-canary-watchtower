### Alerts Module
The alerts module is responsible for pushing alerts through to some monitoring service as well as logging data to a log file. Logging is configured in [logging_config.yaml](./logging_config.yaml).

## TODOs

  - [x] implement polling thread
  - [x] Ethereum Chain:
    - [x] check chain connection
    - [x] check regular block production
    - [x] check eth withdrawals
  - [ ] Fuel Chain State Contract:
    - [ ] check valid state commits
    - [ ] implement alert on pause action timeout 
    - [ ] implement gas escalator on pause action

  - [ ] buffer message alerts to avoid duplicates
  - [ ] send alerts through a broadcasting service like PagerDuty

### Might Want to Add
- We currently only check that committed blocks match what's in the fuel chain. This does not protect us from a bug in the client that might screw up MessageOut receipts and allow for more ETH or tokens to be withdrawn than should be. We might want a setup that keeps a running log of all asset balances that have been approved for withdrawal and then trigger a pause if more are somehow withdrawn than expected. This would require some kind of persistent data store to work efficiently (like the current "alert" concept but with a timing window that spans from the start of the chain to now).
